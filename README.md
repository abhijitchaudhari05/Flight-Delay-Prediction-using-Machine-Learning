Predicting flight arrival delays using large-scale U.S. flight data.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project builds models to **predict arrival delays** and identify the **key factors** contributing to them.
It includes:

* Regression (predict delay minutes)
* Classification (predict if delay > 15 min)
* Feature engineering
* SHAP model explainability
* Error analysis for operational insights

The project is optimized for clarity, performance, and real-world usability.

## 🔧 **Project Workflow**

1. **Data loading & cleaning**
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
3. **Feature engineering**
4. **Encoding & scaling**
5. **Machine learning models**
6. **Model interpretation (SHAP)**

## 📊 **Key Insights**

* **Departure Delay** is the strongest predictor across all models.
* Distance, scheduled time, airline, route, and airport congestion all influence predictions.
* Evening flights show higher unpredictability due to **delay propagation**.
* Error patterns vary strongly by airline and route.
